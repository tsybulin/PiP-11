README

To use this sample you need a Raspberry Pi 5 or a MCP7941x real-time clock (RTC)
attached to the I2C master of other Raspberry Pi models. By default it is
reading the date and time from the RTC (when it is set correctly) and sets the
system time from it. The time is displayed afterwards. This sample uses UTC
because the RTC should run using it.

If the RTC time is unset, you can set the RTC time from a NTP server. This is
done automatically, when the current RTC year is less than 2000. This only works
with Raspberry Pi models with on-board Ethernet controller. Don't forget to
connect it to the network before starting the sample.

Before building the sample you may have to configure it. You should set your
time zone (in minutes difference to UTC).
