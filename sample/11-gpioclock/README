README 

This sample program shows the usage of GPIO clocks and provides a little
sampling routine. GPIO clock 0 is initialized to generate an 125 KHz square wave
signal on GPIO pin 4. The signal on GPIO pin 18 is sampled with a sampling rate
of some MHz and displayed on the screen afterwards. If you connect both pins you
can see the square wave.
