README

This sample program creates a listing of the files in the root directory of a
connected USB drive (WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY IMPORTANT DATA). The first
primary partition of the USB drive must be a FAT16 or FAT32 partition. Extended
partitions or other file systems are not supported.

After creating the directory listing a file "circle.txt" is created in the root
directory and some text is written to it. After closing the file it is re-opened
and its contents is read and written to the screen.

If your USB drive is not detected at all, you may have to use the option
"usbpowerdelay=" in the file cmdline.txt on the SD card. See the file
doc/cmdline.txt for details.
