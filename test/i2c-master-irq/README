README

This test sends up to 16 bytes to an I2C device and receives up to 16 bytes from
the device then. The I2C address of the device, the I2C clock frequency, the
send bytes and the number of received bytes can be configured in the file
kernel.cpp. By default the chip ID register of a BMP180 digital air pressure
sensor is read and displayed. This test uses the IRQ-driven I2C master driver.
