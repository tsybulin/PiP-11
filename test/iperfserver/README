README

This test program is a server for the iperf (version 2) network performance
measurement tool. It is only working on Raspberry Pi models with on-board
Ethernet controller. You need a second computer (host) with iperf installed in
your local network to use it. iperf2 can be downloaded from (go to "Files" for
the source code to be build on Linux machines):

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/

Before building the sample you may have to update the network configuration
(DHCP is used by default) in kernel.cpp to meet your local network
configuration. Don't forget to connect your local Ethernet to the Ethernet
connector of the Raspberry Pi.

After initialization the sample program is waiting for incoming TCP connections
on port 5001. Try the "iperf -c" (client) command - as given on the screen of
your Raspberry Pi - from the host computer. Your Raspberry Pi should inform about
an incoming connection on the screen with the IP address and port number of the
client. After 10 seconds iperf will stop sending data and displays the
performance results. The Raspberry Pi should do the same.

Please note that this sample program allows unidirectional TCP connections only
(iperf options -u, -d, -r cannot be used).

When you add the option "fast=true" to the file cmdline.txt on the SD card, the
Raspberry Pi runs at full speed. The bandwidth may be increased then.
