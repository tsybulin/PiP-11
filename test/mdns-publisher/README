This test publishes a "_apple-midi._udp" service using mDNS / Bonjour. The
service itself is not implemented. After 60 seconds the service is unpublished
again. You might have to open your personal firewall for this test.

On a Linux host you can browse mDNS services using:

$ avahi-browse -r _apple-midi._udp
+ enp1s0 IPv4 MIDI-Test                                     _apple-midi._udp     local
= enp1s0 IPv4 MIDI-Test                                     _apple-midi._udp     local
   hostname = [raspberrypi.local]
   address = [192.168.0.151]
   port = [5004]
   txt = ["Sample service"]
- enp1s0 IPv4 MIDI-Test                                     _apple-midi._udp     local
