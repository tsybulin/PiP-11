First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. Write a colourmatrix to
screen. Write some logging messages to screen or UART. Continiously moves the
cursor around the screen on a loop after matrix is printed.

You can create a file cmdline.txt like this on the SD(HC) card to change the
frame buffer size:

width=640 height=480

In the same file you can control the logging feature by these options (append
them to the same line):

logdev=ttyS1 loglevel=4

(write logging messages to UART now, default is to screen ("tty1"), the loglevel
controls the amount of messages produced (0: only panic, 1: also errors, 2: also
warnings, 3: also notices, 4: also debug output (default))
